# Vaccination Alert System (VAS)
Our product, the Vaccination alert system, is aimed to alert parents of the upcoming vaccine that has to be administered to the child. This system ensures that no child misses out on a critical vaccination that can save the child's life.




When a child is born the admin enters the child's name into the database. For all the vaccines including the earliest vaccine(within 12hrs of birth), the parents will be alerted through their choice of contact(SMS or Email).



As and when the vaccination is administered, the doctor on call will update the database, checking the administered vaccine off the list.

Upon Registering a birthdate, email address, and phone number, the reminders will be sent per the WHOâ€™s official vaccination recommendations.
